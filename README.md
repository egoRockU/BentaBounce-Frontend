Project: BentaBounce

About the project: BentaBounce is an online store where users can sell their own items and buy items. BentaBounce, a playful combination of "Benta"(sale) and "Bounce"(leave), embodies its core values of promoting a bustiling and dynamic online marketplace. Administrators have full access to the system and database, as well as the ability to confirm orders and distribute income. On the other hand, users can be buyers and sellers at the same time.

How  the system works? BentaBounce can function like a normal e-commerce system, where users can create profiles and start their transactions. They can also add products and edit the item's content. The admin will then confirm the orders, deliver the items, and distribute the payment to the respective sellers.

Pages: Landing Page, Sign Up/Log In, Profile Page, Add/Edit Product Page, See All Items Page, Category Items, Search Results Page, Item Details, Shopping Cart, Summary of Orders, Checkout Modal, and Admin Login and Dashboard

Features: E-commerce CRUD, Search Items, Category & Price Filters, PayPal Payment, and Google Log In

Instruction: For easy and faster way, contact the developers so they could start the backend server. Then you can download the front-end source code. Make sure you have node installed in your machine. Open the project folder in your terminal and run "npm i -D vite" and "npm run dev". You can now open the application on the localhost port displayed on the vite server terminal.
